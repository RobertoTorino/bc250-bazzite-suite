"""Decides whether bc250-cu-bisect.sh's own recorded results accept a combined mask for install.

Nothing here runs the bisect script or any register write; it only reads the state the script already
keeps in ~/.local/share/bc250-cu-bisect/. A mask is only accepted once that state proves:

  - it was retested as its own baseline (umr-config BASE), with every WGP in it unlocked, so the
    recorded run has no individual "SEx.SHy.WGPn" items left, only "control";
  - every round of that retest is recorded with outcome PASS (no crash, no drift, no mismatch);
  - no attempt is still marked as in progress (umr-pending would mean an interrupted run); and
  - the 4 shader-array rows are unlocked evenly, at one of the three real levels: 3 WGPs per row
    (24 CUs, stock), 4 per row (32 CUs) or 5 per row (40 CUs, max). The GPU feeds all 4 arrays in
    lockstep, so anything in between performs like its smallest row while drawing the extra power
    (see the bc250-cu-bisect.sh README).

This mirrors the "retest the combination" step bc250-cu-bisect.sh's own summary suggests
(--reset && --baseline <masks> --control-only --rounds N) - the GUI just checks that step was actually
done and passed.
