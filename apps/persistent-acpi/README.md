# bc250-persistent-acpi

Safe alternative to BIOS flashing: a **persistent** ACPI fix for the AMD BC-250 that gives the
board CPU C-states (idle) and frequency scaling (800 MHz – 3.2 GHz, 8 steps) on Linux —
without the P3.00 MeiMeiDXE v3 modded BIOS.

The ACPI tables come from [e-tho/bc250-acpi-fix](https://github.com/e-tho/bc250-acpi-fix)
(maintained fork of [bc250-collective/bc250-acpi-fix](https://github.com/bc250-collective/bc250-acpi-fix)),
vendored here from release **v1.1.1**. Three SSDT overrides are loaded from an early initrd via the
kernel's [ACPI table upgrade](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/acpi/initrd_table_override.html):

| Table | Fixes |
|---|---|
| `SSDT-CPU` | Replaces the broken idle-state table (C-states) |
| `SSDT-PST` | Publishes the 8 frequency states |
| `SSDT-STUBS` | Defines missing firmware methods as no-ops |

Works on stock 6-core and unlocked 8-core boards, on all stock BIOS versions
(1.00, 2.00, 3.00 and 5.00 share the same DSDT).

## Is this ACPI fix persistent?

**Yes, it survives updates**:

* `/boot/acpi_override.cpio` — extra files in `/boot` are left alone by `rpm-ostree`
  / bootc image updates; only `/boot/ostree` and `/boot/loader` are managed.
* `/etc/default/grub` — `/etc` is machine-local state on ostree systems and is
  3-way-merged across deployments, so the `GRUB_EARLY_INITRD_LINUX_CUSTOM` line stays.
* **Kernel updates**: Fedora's `blscfg` GRUB module prepends the early initrd to **every**
  BLS boot entry at boot time, including kernels installed later. No re-install, no
  regeneration needed after a kernel or image update.

Unlike BIOS flashing it is fully reversible (Uninstall in the app,
`sudo ./bc250-acpi-override.sh --uninstall`, or just delete the file and the GRUB line) and
carries zero bricking risk.

## Install (Bazzite / Universal Blue)

Install the app from the BC250 Bazzite Suite portal, or from a clone or release folder, as your
own user (not with sudo):

```bash
./install.sh                         # app menu entry and Desktop icon
./install.sh --no-desktop-shortcut   # app menu entry only
```

Installing the app changes nothing on the board. Open **BC-250 Persistent ACPI** and click
**Install**, then reboot. The window shows whether the override is installed, the CPU's
frequency steps and idle states, and (with **Status with sudo**) whether the kernel loaded the
tables this boot.

From a terminal, without the app:

```bash
sudo ./bc250-acpi-override.sh --install
# reboot
```

The installer checks for a BC-250 GPU, warns on modded BIOSes (duplicate tables fail to
load — do **not** combine this with a modded BIOS that injects its own fixes), verifies
`CONFIG_ACPI_TABLE_UPGRADE`, installs the cpio, adds the GRUB line idempotently and runs
`ujust regenerate-grub` (or `grub2-mkconfig` on plain Fedora, where the path in
`GRUB_EARLY_INITRD_LINUX_CUSTOM` is relative to `/boot/grub2/`). In a terminal a warning asks
"Continue anyway?"; the app shows the warning in a dialog. `--yes` answers yes to both warnings.

### Manual install

```bash
sudo cp tables/acpi_override.cpio /boot/
echo 'GRUB_EARLY_INITRD_LINUX_CUSTOM="../../acpi_override.cpio"' | sudo tee -a /etc/default/grub
ujust regenerate-grub   # then reboot
```

## Verify

The app's status shows the same information. From a terminal:

```bash
./bc250-acpi-override.sh --status                    # installed? frequency steps, idle states
sudo dmesg | grep -iE 'ACPI.*(SSDT|Table Upgrade)'   # 3 tables loaded as override
cpupower frequency-info                              # 8 steps, 800 MHz - 3.2 GHz
cpupower idle-info                                   # POLL, C1, C2 (C2 at 0x414)
```

Or run test 26 of [bc250-bazzite-test](../bazzite-test),
which reports whether the ACPI tables came from the initrd override or the BIOS.

## Uninstall

Click **Uninstall** in the app and reboot, or from a terminal:

```bash
sudo ./bc250-acpi-override.sh --uninstall
# reboot
```

To remove the app itself: `./install.sh --uninstall` (add `--purge` to also remove its
settings). This leaves the override as it is; uninstall the override first if you want the
board back on the BIOS tables.
