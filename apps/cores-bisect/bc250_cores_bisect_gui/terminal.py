"""Starts a command in a visible terminal window, detached from this process.

bc250-cores-bisect.sh needs a real TTY: in the default (non ``--auto``) mode it asks interactive
questions (unlock now? reboot now? did it crash?), and either way its output is exactly what a user
running it by hand would want to see on screen. So the setup GUI doesn't run the script itself - it
hands the fully-assembled command line to a terminal emulator and gets out of the way, same spirit
as the ``konsole --title ... -e tail -f auto.log`` example in
bc250-cores-bisect-auto.service.example.
