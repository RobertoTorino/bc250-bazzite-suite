"""Decides whether bc250-cores-bisect.sh's own recorded results accept the core unlock for install.

Nothing here runs the bisect script or touches the SMU; it only reads the state the script already
keeps in ~/.local/share/bc250-cores-bisect/. The verdict mirrors the script's own summary - the unlock
is accepted only when that state proves:

  - the run reached the bisect phase (the unlock was applied and the new cores came up);
  - no attempt is still marked as in progress (pending = an interrupted run);
  - the control (stock 6C/12T, before the unlock) never failed;
  - post-control, every new core alone and the combined item each have a result for every round,
    and every one of those results is PASS (no MCE, verify failure, crash, ...).

Because the SMU primitive enables all cores or none, a single failed item rejects the unlock as a whole.
Fewer control rounds than --rounds, or attempts that ran a shorter load than the current --time, are
reported as notes but don't block - the script's own verdict treats them the same way.
