# BC-250 CU Bisect

![BC-250 CU Bisect](../assets/cu-bisect/bc250-cu-bisect.png){ .app-logo }

Tells **bad CUs** apart from an **unstable CU unlock** on the AMD BC-250 (Cyan Skillfish, gfx1013).

Every BC-250 die differs: AMD fuses off WGPs that failed validation. But a crash after a CU unlock doesn't
have to mean a bad WGP. A runtime unlock writes GPU registers while the driver is running, the kernel and
RADV keep their 24-CU view, and extra CUs draw more power at the same voltage. Crashes that move from one
CU pair to another usually point to the unlock, power or heat, not to bad silicon.

`bc250-cu-bisect.sh` does its own unlock, so no other tool is involved, and tests in a way that separates
these causes.

> **Warning:** this writes GPU registers. A bad WGP or the unlock itself can freeze the system. Save your
> work first. Use at your own risk.

## Unlocking extra CUs, step by step

New here? This is the whole process, start to finish. If you only read one section, read this one.

**What you're doing:** your board ships with **24 CUs** active. Up to 16 more are switched off. Some of
them are genuinely defective (AMD fused them off for a reason), some are perfectly fine. These scripts
find out which, and then switch on the good ones at every boot.

**The only three outcomes.** The GPU is built as 4 identical "shader array" rows and it feeds all 4 in
lockstep, so a row with fewer active CUs holds the other three back. That means only three settings do
anything useful, and the tools here will not let you install anything else:

| Setting                | Mask                  | What you get                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **24 CUs** (default)   | `0x07,0x07,0x07,0x07` | What the board does out of the box |
| **32 CUs**             | `0x0f,0x0f,0x0f,0x0f` | +1 good WGP on each of the 4 rows |
| **40 CUs** (max)       | `0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f` | +2 good WGPs on each of the 4 rows |

Anything in between (e.g. 5 extra CUs on one row, none on another) is **rejected**: it would boot and run,
just no faster than 24 CUs, while using more power and making more heat. So realistically you're aiming
for 32, and trying for 40.

---

**Step 1 — Install the prerequisites and read the warning.**
See [Requirements](#requirements) and [Before you start](#before-you-start). You need `umr`, and ideally
`memtest_vulkan`. Close your games, save your work: this *will* freeze the machine at some point, by design.

**Step 2 — Find out which switched-off CUs are good (`bc250-cu-bisect.sh`).**

```bash
chmod +x bc250-cu-bisect.sh
./bc250-cu-bisect.sh
```

It tests **one** switched-off WGP (= 2 CUs) at a time, under real GPU load, then asks you to reboot and
run it again for the next one. There are 8 switched-off WGPs and 3 test rounds each, so about **27 boots**
in total — expect this to take a day or two of on-and-off fiddling. Use `--auto` if you want it to reboot
by itself without asking (see [Running truly unattended](#running-truly-unattended---auto-checklist)).
Each WGP ends up GOOD, FAILS EVERY TIME (bad silicon — leave it off) or RANDOM (see [Results](#results)).

**Step 3 — Read the suggestion at the end.**
When every WGP has a verdict, the script prints the best **even** mask your board supports, e.g.:

```
- WGPs that passed every round: SE0.SH0.WGP3 SE0.SH1.WGP3 SE1.SH0.WGP3 SE1.SH1.WGP3
  Combined: 0x0f,0x0f,0x0f,0x0f (32 CUs, WGPs per row: 4 4 4 4).
```

If one row had a bad WGP, the script automatically trims the others down to match, so what it suggests is
always 24, 32 or 40 — never a lopsided number like 38.

**Step 4 — Retest that exact combination (this step is not optional).**
WGPs that each pass alone can still fail *together*, because more active CUs means more power draw at the
same voltage. So run the suggested command, which tests the full combined mask in one go:

```bash
./bc250-cu-bisect.sh --reset && ./bc250-cu-bisect.sh --baseline 0x0f,0x0f,0x0f,0x0f --control-only --rounds 1
```

(Replace the mask with whatever *your* run suggested.) This is a single boot, not another 27.

**Step 5 — Make it permanent (`bc250-cu-unlock.sh`).**
A CU unlock is only ever register writes — nothing is burned into the chip — so it's gone after a reboot.
This second script reapplies it automatically at every boot, as a system service that runs before your
desktop starts:

```bash
chmod +x bc250-cu-unlock.sh
sudo ./bc250-cu-unlock.sh --install 0x0f,0x0f,0x0f,0x0f
```

That's it — from now on the board comes up with 32 (or 40) CUs on every boot, including cold boots and
after system updates. It refuses the install if the mask isn't one of the three even settings.

**Step 6 — Verify it's actually live.**

```bash
sudo ./bc250-cu-unlock.sh --status     # "Live masks now:" is read straight off the GPU
```

Trust that line over any CU count shown by other GPU tools — most of them cache the number the driver saw
at boot (see [the note further down](#keeping-the-unlock-after-a-reboot)).

**Step 7 — Want to go back?**

```bash
sudo ./bc250-cu-unlock.sh --uninstall  # stock 24 CUs again from the next boot
```

Do this if the system starts misbehaving later: a WGP that passed the tests can still turn out unstable
under a different game or a hotter room.

> **Prefer clicking over typing?** There are two optional GUIs that do exactly the same thing:
> [BC Bisect GUI](#bc-bisect-gui-initial-setup-launcher) for steps 2–4 and
> [BC Unlock GUI](#bc-unlock-gui) for steps 5–7. The Unlock GUI shows a green **ACCEPTED** banner only
> once your results actually justify the mask, and greys out **Install** otherwise.

## How it works

The script writes the three registers of a runtime CU unlock with [umr](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/tomstdenis/umr):

| Register                         | Per shader array | Meaning                                    |
|----------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `CC_GC_SHADER_ARRAY_CONFIG`      | yes              | Bits 16-20 mark WGPs inactive; cleared to 0 |
| `SPI_PG_ENABLE_STATIC_WGP_MASK`  | yes              | WGPs that get work (5 bits, 2 CUs each)    |
| `RLC_PG_ALWAYS_ON_WGP_MASK`      | no               | Union of the four SPI masks                |

The BC-250 has 4 shader arrays (SE0.SH0, SE0.SH1, SE1.SH0, SE1.SH1) of 5 WGPs: 40 CUs. Stock is 24.

```
             WGP0   WGP1   WGP2   WGP3   WGP4      mask (bit4..bit0)
             bit0   bit1   bit2   bit3   bit4
SE0.SH0       ██     ██     ██     ..     ..      0x07
SE0.SH1       ██     ██     ██     ..     ..      0x07
SE1.SH0       ██     ██     ██     ..     ..      0x07
SE1.SH1       ██     ██     ██     ..     ..      0x07

██ baseline, always unlocked (the stock 24 CUs)   .. locked WGP, 2 CUs, not yet tested
```

Each row is a 5-bit `SPI_PG_ENABLE_STATIC_WGP_MASK` value: WGP0 is bit 0, WGP4 is bit 4, a set bit means
that WGP is unlocked (2 CUs). Reading the stock row above left to right gives `00111` = `0x07` (WGP0-2
unlocked, WGP3-4 locked). A fully-unlocked row (all 5 WGPs, `11111`) is `0x1f`. The 4 rows are always
written together as `SE0.SH0,SE0.SH1,SE1.SH0,SE1.SH1`, so the stock baseline above is `0x07,0x07,0x07,0x07`
(24 CUs) and a fully unlocked board would be `0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f` (40 CUs) - this is exactly the format
`--baseline` takes and `--status`/the GUI print back.

That's the default layout: 3 of the 5 WGPs per shader array ship unlocked (24 CUs), the other 2 per array
(8 WGPs, 16 CUs) are fused off at the factory and are what this script tests one by one. The script shows
this same map live while it runs, with `>>` on the WGP under test and `ok`/`xx`/`??` once a WGP has a
verdict (GOOD/FAILS EVERY TIME/RANDOM) — see [Results](#results).

The test plan:

- **Control:** the same register writes with your baseline masks, so no extra CUs. If the control fails,
  the unlock method, power or heat is at fault, and the WGP verdicts can't blame your CUs.
- **One step per locked WGP:** baseline + that single WGP (2 CUs). Every locked WGP is tested on its own.
- **Rounds:** every item runs several times (default 3), interleaved, so heat and time don't favor one item.
- **One attempt per boot** (default): every attempt starts from the clean driver state.
- **Idle writes:** the masks are only written while the GPU is idle, then read back. During the load they
  are read again every 10 s to catch masks that drift.
- **Correctness, not only crashes:** `memtest_vulkan` reports wrong results. vkpeak, vkmark and glmark2
  are used when it's missing, but only show crashes.
- **Crash-safe:** before every phase the script saves what it's doing. After a freeze, cold boot and run
  it again: it records the crash, with the phase (writing the masks or under load) and the GPU faults in
  the kernel log of the previous boot.

## Requirements

- AMD BC-250, Linux with bash 4+. Tested against Bazzite (Fedora Atomic).
- `umr`, owned by root, in `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin` or `/usr/local/bin`.
  On Bazzite: `sudo rpm-ostree install umr`, then reboot. "Already requested" means it's waiting for that reboot.
- A GPU load tool, preferably [memtest_vulkan](https://github.com/GpuZelenograd/memtest_vulkan/releases)
  in `~/.local/bin` (or vkpeak, vkmark, glmark2).
- sudo rights (for umr and the kernel log only).

## Before you start

1. Every boot must start at the stock state: turn off anything that applies a CU unlock at boot, and don't
   run other CU tools during the test. The script refuses to start when an unlock is already active.
2. Cap the GPU governor at 1500 MHz (for example in `/etc/cyan-skillfish-governor-smu/config.toml`), so
   power and heat don't hide the result. The script warns when the ceiling is higher.
3. Close games and video players.

## Usage

Run it as your normal user:

```bash
chmod +x bc250-cu-bisect.sh
./bc250-cu-bisect.sh                 # baseline = the stock masks of this boot, 3 rounds, 180 s load
./bc250-cu-bisect.sh -t 300 -r 5     # longer load, more rounds
./bc250-cu-bisect.sh --baseline 0x07,0x07,0x07,0x07   # start from masks you trust
./bc250-cu-bisect.sh --baseline 0x0f,0x0f,0x0f,0x0f --control-only --rounds 1   # re-validate a combined mask, control only
./bc250-cu-bisect.sh --status        # results so far, report on the Desktop
./bc250-cu-bisect.sh --same-boot     # no reboots: restore the baseline live between attempts
./bc250-cu-bisect.sh --auto          # no prompts, auto-reboot after each attempt (see below)
./bc250-cu-bisect.sh --reset         # delete the results and start over
./bc250-cu-bisect.sh --help
```

After each attempt it offers to power off (best, a cold boot) or reboot. Power on and run it again until
all attempts are done. With 3 rounds and 8 locked WGPs that's 27 boots; `--same-boot` is faster but every
attempt then inherits the state of the previous one.

### How long a full run takes

Total attempts = rounds × (1 control + locked WGPs). Each attempt itself takes about 15 s settle +
the load time (`--time`, default 180 s) + a few seconds overhead, so roughly `load time + 20 s` of
active GPU time per attempt. On top of that:

| Test type                                   | Per-attempt overhead                         | Example: 3 rounds, 8 locked WGPs (27 attempts), default 180 s load |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Default (reboot/power-off between attempts)   | a full boot (and your own click-through time) | 27 × (~200 s + a boot) -- typically 2-3 hours including reboots     |
| `--same-boot`                                 | 30 s cooldown, no reboot                      | 27 × ~230 s ≈ 1 h 45 min hands-off                                   |
| `--auto` (+ the systemd unit, see below)      | a full boot, but no manual steps              | same wall-clock as the default mode, but unattended                 |
| `--control-only`                              | only the control item is tested               | `rounds` attempts instead of `rounds × (1 + WGPs)`, e.g. 3 instead of 27 |

More rounds (`-r`) or a longer load (`-t`) scale the total time linearly; more locked WGPs add one
more item (and `rounds` more attempts) each.

### Running truly unattended (`--auto` checklist)

Clicking through 27 reboots by hand is slow. `--auto` keeps the same one-attempt-per-boot isolation
(no loss of correctness) but removes the manual steps:

- it doesn't ask anything (an unfinished attempt is assumed to be a crash, warnings are passed through),
- it reboots on its own when more attempts are left, instead of asking.

Combine it with the included systemd user unit so the script also relaunches itself after every login,
turning the whole bisect into a loop you only have to start once:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp bc250-cu-bisect-auto.service.example ~/.config/systemd/user/bc250-cu-bisect-auto.service
# edit ExecStart in that file to the real path of bc250-cu-bisect.sh
systemctl --user enable --now bc250-cu-bisect-auto.service
systemctl --user status bc250-cu-bisect-auto.service 
```

`--auto` makes the *script* hands-off, but the *system* must get back to your session on its own:

* **Autologin** — after each reboot someone must log in, or the run stalls at the login screen. Enable it in your desktop (Bazzite/KDE: System Settings → Colors & Themes → Login Screen (SDDM) → Behavior → auto-login, or Users → auto-login on GNOME).
* It still needs sudo for `umr` and the kernel log, without a password prompt (there's no terminal to type one into). Add a sudoers drop-in:

```bash
echo "$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/bc250-cu-bisect
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/bc250-cu-bisect
sudo visudo -cf /etc/sudoers.d/bc250-cu-bisect   # must print "parsed OK"
sudo -k && sudo -n true && echo OK    # must print OK without asking
```
Revert after testing with `sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/bc250-cu-bisect`.
If you edit the file by hand, use `sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/bc250-cu-bisect`: it refuses to save a broken line.
A broken line makes every `sudo` command print a warning, or stops sudo working at all.

`systemctl reboot` is tried first with `--no-ask-password` (so it fails instead of popping up a GUI
auth dialog nobody is there to answer), falling back to `sudo -n systemctl reboot`; if both fail the
script stops instead of hanging and tells you to reboot by hand. Add passwordless sudo for
`systemctl reboot`/`poweroff` too if your desktop doesn't already allow the logged-in user to do that
directly (most do).

For a truly unattended run (e.g. overnight), make sure of this as well:

* **The autostart unit installed** — without it nothing restarts the script after login, and you'd have to start it manually every boot.
* **No credential popups at login (KDE Wallet / ksshaskpass)** — with autologin the KDE Wallet can't auto-unlock, so a "SSH credentials" / wallet dialog can appear at session start and block the chain until answered. Either give the wallet a blank password (open it in `kwalletmanager5`first, then Change Password → empty), or disable the wallet subsystem (Plasma 6 has no UI checkbox for it anymore):

```bash
kwriteconfig6 --file kwalletrc --group Wallet --key Enabled false   # kwriteconfig5 on Plasma 5
```

Re-enable afterward with `... --key Enabled true`. Also uncheck "Use KWallet for the Secret
Service interface" in System Settings → KDE Wallet so apps don't route secrets to the disabled wallet.

Check on it while it runs:

```bash
systemctl --user status bc250-cu-bisect-auto.service   # ran / running / failed this boot
tail -f ~/.local/share/bc250-cu-bisect/auto.log         # live output of the current attempt
./bc250-cu-bisect.sh --status                           # progress and results so far
```

When all attempts are done the script stops rebooting on its own, and in `--auto` mode it also
disables `bc250-cu-bisect-auto.service` and removes the optional live-output autostart entry (below)
by itself, so nothing starts at the next login. Starting a new `--auto` run re-enables the unit again
automatically if it's still installed but was left disabled; it warns instead if the unit isn't
installed at all (meaning the run couldn't have continued past a reboot). If you ran without `--auto`,
disable the unit manually: `systemctl --user disable --now bc250-cu-bisect-auto.service`.
A real freeze still needs a manual power cycle, same as without `--auto`; the script picks the resume
back up from there as usual.

Want the live output on screen instead of a log file? Add a desktop autostart entry that opens a
terminal following it at every login (KDE example; see the comments in
`bc250-cu-bisect-auto.service.example`):

```bash
cat > ~/.config/autostart/bc250-cu-bisect-watch.desktop <<'EOF'
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=BC-250 bisect live output
Exec=konsole --title "bc250-cu-bisect" -e tail -n 40 -f .local/share/bc250-cu-bisect/auto.log
EOF
```

## Results

While it runs, and in the summary/report, the same CU map shows where it's at:

```
             WGP0   WGP1   WGP2   WGP3   WGP4
SE0.SH0       ██     ██     ██     ok     ..
SE0.SH1       ██     ██     ██     xx     ..
SE1.SH0       ██     ██     ██     ..     ??
SE1.SH1       ██     ██     ██     >>     ..

██ baseline  >> testing now  ok passed every round  xx fails every time  ?? random  .. not tested yet
```

Outcomes per attempt:

| Outcome       | Meaning                                                                |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PASS`        | Load ran the full time, no errors, no kernel faults, masks held        |
| `ERRORS`      | memtest_vulkan reported wrong results                                  |
| `FAULT`       | GPU fault in the kernel log (ring timeout, GPU reset, page fault, ...) |
| `LOAD-FAIL`   | The load tool stopped early                                            |
| `CRASH-LOAD`  | The system went down under load                                       |
| `CRASH-APPLY` | The system went down while writing the masks on an idle GPU           |
| `DRIFT`       | The masks changed after they were written                              |
| `MISMATCH`    | The masks didn't read back as written                                  |
| `ABORTED`     | Stopped by hand; the attempt runs again                                |

Verdict per WGP:

- **GOOD:** passed every round.
- **FAILS EVERY TIME:** likely a bad WGP; leave it locked. "(memory errors)" when memtest_vulkan found errors.
- **RANDOM:** failed in some rounds only. A bad WGP normally fails every time, so this points to the
  unlock method, power or heat.

`CRASH-APPLY`, `DRIFT` and `MISMATCH` point to the unlock itself. When the control fails, the WGP
verdicts are not reliable.

When everything is done and the control passed, the script suggests a combined mask of the good WGPs.
WGPs that pass one by one can still fail together (more power at the same voltage), so test the
combination: `./bc250-cu-bisect.sh --reset && ./bc250-cu-bisect.sh --baseline <masks> --control-only --rounds 1`.
`--control-only` skips re-bisecting any WGP that's still locked in `<masks>` (e.g. one you already know
is bad and deliberately left out) — only the `control` item runs, so this is a single-boot check instead
of another full bisect. The suggested mask is always already even (24, 32 or 40 CUs): if one row has a bad
WGP, the script trims the other rows down to match, because an uneven mask can't be installed and wouldn't
be faster anyway. Once the combination also passes, make it survive a reboot with
[bc250-cu-unlock.sh](#keeping-the-unlock-after-a-reboot).

Files, in `~/.local/share/bc250-cu-bisect/`:

- `umr-runs.tsv`: one line per attempt (time, boot, round, item, masks, outcome, memtest errors, kernel
  faults, drift, max temperature, max clock, max GPU busy, note).
- `umr-config`: baseline, rounds and load time.
- `logs/`: the load tool's output per attempt.

A readable report is written to the Desktop when all attempts are done, and with `--status`.

## Keeping the unlock after a reboot

A runtime unlock resets to stock every boot (it only ever writes registers, nothing is fused), so by
default you're back to 24 CUs the next time you start the system. `bc250-cu-unlock.sh` is a separate,
standalone script that reapplies a mask you've already validated, every boot, as a root systemd service
started before the display manager. It does not retest anything — it's not a diagnostic, only use it once
a mask has actually passed the bisect above:

```bash
chmod +x bc250-cu-unlock.sh
sudo ./bc250-cu-unlock.sh --install 0x0f,0x0f,0x0f,0x0f   # save, apply now, enable at every boot
./bc250-cu-unlock.sh --status                             # installed masks, service state, live masks
sudo ./bc250-cu-unlock.sh --uninstall                     # disable it; stock 24 CUs from the next boot
```

**Only 24, 32 and 40 CUs can be installed.** `--install` (and a bare apply) check the mask before touching
a single register and refuse anything that isn't 3, 4 or 5 WGPs on *every* one of the 4 shader-array rows:

```
$ sudo ./bc250-cu-unlock.sh --install 0x1f,0x1f,0x07,0x07
ERROR: uneven mask 0x1f,0x1f,0x07,0x07 - 5/5/3/3 WGPs on SE0.SH0/SE0.SH1/SE1.SH0/SE1.SH1.
  The GPU drives all 4 shader arrays in lockstep, so an uneven unlock runs no faster than its
  smallest row while burning the extra power. Unlock the SAME number of WGPs on every row.
  Allowed: 3 per row = 24 CUs (stock), 4 per row = 32 CUs, 5 per row = 40 CUs (max).
  Example 32 CUs: 0x0f,0x0f,0x0f,0x0f     Example 40 CUs: 0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f
```

**Once `--install` has run, the unlock is persistent**: the systemd service re-applies the saved mask
automatically on every single boot from then on, with no further action needed — you do not need to
re-run the script, and it survives reboots, power-offs/cold boots, and kernel/OS updates alike. Only
`--uninstall` (or deleting the service/config by hand) turns that off again.

Only install a mask that:

- passed with the control (no crashes with just the baseline masks),
- came back GOOD for every WGP in it, on its own, in `bc250-cu-bisect.sh`,
- was then also tested as the combined mask itself (see above — WGPs that pass alone can still fail
  together), and
- unlocks the same number of WGPs on all 4 shader arrays — 24, 32 or 40 CUs (enforced, see above).

Config and the systemd unit:

- `/etc/bc250-cu-bisect/masks`: the installed masks, one line.
- `/etc/systemd/system/bc250-cu-unlock.service`: `Before=display-manager.service`, so the unlock is
  applied before anything starts using the GPU.

A real hang is still a real hang: if a WGP you thought was GOOD turns out unstable under different
conditions later, boot, run `sudo ./bc250-cu-unlock.sh --uninstall`, and reboot again to go back to stock.

### BC Bisect GUI (initial setup launcher)
![bc-cu-bisect-gui.png](../assets/cu-bisect/bc-cu-bisect-gui.png)

`bc250_bisect_gui` is an optional PyQt6 launcher for `bc250-cu-bisect.sh` itself - a menu-driven
"initial setup" screen for noob-friendly first runs. It doesn't run the bisect in-process: pick the
load time, rounds, a baseline variant, `--control-only`/`--same-boot`/`--no-watch`, and whether to run
`--auto` (unattended), then click **Start CU Bisect**. The window closes and hands off to a terminal
running the exact same command line you'd have typed by hand - no hidden behavior, nothing the script
itself doesn't already do.

Baseline is a simple preset picker rather than a free-form field by default: **Auto-detect** (this
boot's own clean masks, the safe default - no `--baseline` is passed), **Stock 24 CUs**
(`0x07,0x07,0x07,0x07`), **Fully unlocked 40 CUs** (`0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f`), or **Custom...** for any
other 4-mask value (validated live, same format `--baseline` takes).

Checking **Unattended** also offers to install the `--auto` resume-after-reboot systemd `--user` unit
for you (writing `~/.config/systemd/user/bc250-cu-bisect-auto.service` and running
`systemctl --user enable --now`) - the same steps as the "Running truly unattended" checklist above,
just automated. **Show status** runs `--status` in a terminal without starting anything.

Run it straight from a clone (any distro):

```bash
cd bc250-bazzite-suite/apps/cu-bisect
python3 -m venv _python && _python/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt && _python/bin/python -m bc250_bisect_gui
```

On Bazzite there's also a self-installer that sets up a private venv under `~/.local`, plus a launcher,
app-menu entry, icon and Desktop icon (`--no-desktop-shortcut` leaves the Desktop icon out) — no `rpm-ostree` layering, nothing outside your home directory:

```bash
bash packaging/bazzite/install-bisect-gui.sh    # installs for your user only
bc250-bisect-gui                                # or launch it from the app menu
bash packaging/bazzite/uninstall-bisect-gui.sh  # removes the launcher again (not any results)
```

A terminal emulator is required to actually see/run the bisect (konsole, gnome-terminal, ptyxis,
xfce4-terminal, foot, alacritty, kitty, x-terminal-emulator or xterm - `$TERMINAL` is tried first);
the GUI shows an error if none is found. The launcher's own interface isn't translated yet (unlike
`bc250_unlock_gui` below); that's a good candidate for a future iteration, along with buttons to tail
the live log and show `--status` inline instead of in a separate terminal.

### BC Unlock GUI
![bc-cu-unlock.png](../assets/cu-bisect/bc-cu-unlock.png)

`bc250_unlock_gui` is an optional PyQt6 front-end for `bc250-cu-unlock.sh`. It doesn't take your word for
it: it reads `bc250-cu-bisect.sh`'s own recorded results and only enables **Install** once they actually
show the combined mask was retested as its own baseline (no locked WGPs left in that run), every round
of that retest passed, and the 4 rows are even. It shows what's missing when they're not — e.g. "still
has 2 WGP(s) under individual test" or "did not pass every round" — and lets you re-check after you've
addressed that. The CU grid lights up green once a mask is accepted. **Uninstall** and **Refresh status**
don't depend on the gate; you can always disable the service. Like the command-line
`bc250-cu-unlock.sh --install` it wraps, clicking **Install** makes the unlock persistent: it's reapplied
on every boot by the same systemd service, without the GUI (or anything else) needing to run again.

Run it straight from a clone (any distro):

```bash
cd bc250-bazzite-suite/apps/cu-bisect
python3 -m venv _python && _python/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt && _python/bin/python -m bc250_unlock_gui
```

On Bazzite there's also a self-installer, same pattern as the bisect GUI above:

```bash
bash packaging/bazzite/install-gui.sh    # installs for your user only
bc250-unlock-cu-gui                      # or launch it from the app menu
bash packaging/bazzite/uninstall-gui.sh  # removes the app again (not the unlock itself)
```

Install/Uninstall run `bc250-cu-unlock.sh` through `sudo` (masked password prompt, passed to `sudo -S`
only, never stored); nothing is installed with `rpm-ostree` for the GUI itself, a venv is enough.

The GUI's own interface is translated (es, fr, de, zh, ja, it, pl, ru included); it follows your system
locale automatically, or force one with `--lang <code>` (e.g. `bc250-unlock-cu-gui --lang de`). An **About**
button shows the app version and repository link, and the window remembers its size and position
between runs.

**Available translations:**

| Code | Language |
|------|----------|
| es   | Spanish  |
| fr   | French   |
| de   | German   |
| zh   | Chinese (Simplified) |
| ja   | Japanese |
| it   | Italian  |
| pl   | Polish   |
| ru   | Russian  |

English is the default/fallback when no translation file matches `--lang` or your system locale.
Translation sources live in `bc250_unlock_gui/translations/*.ts`; open an issue or PR to add another
language.

## Releases

Releases are tagged `cu-bisect-v<x.y.z>` in the suite repository and published on its
[releases](https://github.com/RobertoTorino/bc250-bazzite-suite/releases) page as `cu-bisect-v<x.y.z>.tar.gz`
with a `SHA256SUMS` file. The tarball holds the whole toolset (`bc250-cu-bisect.sh`, `bc250-cu-unlock.sh`, both
GUIs, `packaging/`, images and docs). Download and extract it on the board instead of cloning the repository if you
just want to run the scripts or the GUIs; the portal installs it for you too.
